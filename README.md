Executable can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/sibercat/ConanExiles_ModFileManagement/releases) If your going to use .exe the executable was created by [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe) so you could get a false positive, you know the deal.

Note: The script looks inside **ConanSandbox\Content\Mods** directory  - Be careful before you delete anything make a backup of your mod directory

I got tired of manually searching for 1KB Missing cooked files after cooking and made this little script.

I added 4. Find patch modified files |  for anyone that overwrites vanilla assets | just point to your Mods\Content | point or drop asset_changes.txt and it will do its magic

Key Features:

1. Search for missing cooked files
2. Configuration management
3. Patch modification detection
4. File deletion management
